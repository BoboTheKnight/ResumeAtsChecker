# ResumeBuilder-Backend
ResumeATSchecker is a Java-based web application that takes a resume PDF and a job description as inputs. The application utilizes the Apache OpenNLP library for keyword extraction and matching against the contents of the PDF file. The application extracts the text from the PDF file and identifies the relevant keywords from the job description using OpenNLP. It then calculates the percentage of matched keywords in the resume and identifies any unmatched keywords. The project is designed to assist job seekers in ensuring that their resumes are optimized for applicant tracking systems (ATS) used by many employers. The source code is available on GitHub and is free to use and modify.
